Hi, I am Innei, a software engineer with a passion for open source. I build products with React (Next.js) and develop backend services with NestJS.

- Technical Writer on my website at [静かな森](https://innei.in/posts?view_mode=compact).
- Core contributor on [Follow](https://github.com/RSSNext/Follow). Next-generation information browser.
- Full maintenance and development on [Mix Space](https://github.com/mx-space). A personal space/blog platform with a modern React-based UI and a robust NestJS-powered backend.
- [Shiro](https://github.com/Innei/Shiro). A minimalist personal website embodying the purity of paper and freshness of snow.
- [Afilmory/afilmory](https://github.com/Afilmory/afilmory). A personal photography website celebrating the art of capturing moments with a nostalgic, retro vibe. Blending aperture, film, and memory.

Sometimes, I build small-but-useful tools and experiments.

- [exif-tools](https://github.com/Innei/exif-tools). A modern web app for reading, editing, and transferring EXIF metadata between images.
- [electron-ipc-decorator](https://github.com/Innei/electron-ipc-decorator). Type-safe Electron IPC with decorators and automatic proxy generation.
- [vite-plugin-route-builder](https://github.com/Innei/vite-plugin-route-builder). Route generation helpers for Vite-based apps.
- [Pastel](https://github.com/Innei/Pastel). A kawaii-inspired OKLCH color system with TypeScript types and TailwindCSS v4 integration.
- [smart-webapp-template](https://github.com/innei-template/smart-webapp-template). Modern WebApp Template Optimized for AI-Assisted Development
